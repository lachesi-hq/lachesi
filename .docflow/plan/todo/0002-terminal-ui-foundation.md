# Terminal UI Foundation

## Owning ADRs

- `../../adr/0006-terminal-ui.md`

## Scope

Implement the first foundation for the terminal UI roadmap:

- extract shared native review APIs that can be called by both Tauri commands
  and non-Tauri callers;
- keep Tauri command names and browser mock IPC contracts stable;
- add the initial `lachesi-tui` Rust entrypoint and ratatui rendering skeleton;
- render configured repositories, open pull requests, selected pull request
  metadata, comments, and unified diff loading/error states;
- add the terminal lifecycle guard needed to restore raw mode on exit and panic;
- add task runner/script entrypoints while preserving `Makefile`/`justfile`
  recipe parity.

Out of scope: full staged comment authoring/publish, split diff rendering,
separate repository extraction, and rebuilding a full git TUI.

## Exit Criteria

- ADR 0006 AC1: a separate Rust TUI entrypoint or workspace crate exists in
  this repository.
- ADR 0006 AC2: read-only provider/review flows reuse existing Rust native
  config, credential, provider, local repository, and review modules.
- ADR 0006 AC3: existing Tauri command names and mock IPC contracts remain
  stable unless intentionally updated in the same change.
- ADR 0006 AC4: the TUI can render configured repositories, open pull requests,
  selected pull request details, comments, and unified diff states.
- ADR 0006 AC6: focused terminal render/layout tests run without a real
  terminal session.

## Dependencies

- `../../adr/0006-terminal-ui.md`
- GitHub issues #80, #81, and #82
- `.docflow/plan/todo/0001-agentic-code-policy-pack.md` remains the earlier
  queue item and should land first unless the maintainer reprioritizes the
  queue.
