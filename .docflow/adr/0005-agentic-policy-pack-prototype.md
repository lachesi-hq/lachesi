# ADR 0005 - Publish an agentic code review policy pack prototype

## Context

Lachesi can load local policy packs from repository configuration. The product
strategy calls out policy packs as the near-term wedge for proving local-first
review governance and future commercial packaging.

The repository needs a concrete pack that exercises the public pack contract
without exposing private customer context or pretending there is already a
hosted registry.

## Capability statement

Lachesi will include a public `agentic-code` policy pack prototype under
`examples/policy-packs/`. The pack demonstrates the local manifest format,
agentic-code review rules, named profiles, analyzer defaults, and example
review output while staying installable from a local path.

## User stories / scenarios

- As a maintainer, I can dogfood a realistic policy pack against Lachesi and
  other repositories.
- As a contributor, I can inspect a working pack format without relying on
  private policy content.
- As a future commercial pack author, I can adapt the public prototype into a
  private pack without changing the loader contract.

## Acceptance criteria

1. A local `agentic-code` pack manifest exists under `examples/policy-packs/`.
2. The pack contains 15-25 agentic review rules across prompt, path, and AST
   oriented policy declarations.
3. The pack exposes `agentic-fast`, `agentic-balanced`, and `agentic-strict`
   profiles.
4. Example repository config and example markdown/JSON outputs are included.
5. Documentation explains how to adapt the pack safely without committing
   private customer context or credentials.
6. A test loads the checked-in pack through the existing local pack loader.

## Out of scope

- A hosted policy registry.
- Private or paid policy distribution.
- A complete static-analysis runtime for every rule.

## Open questions

- None.
