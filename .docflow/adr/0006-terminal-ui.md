# ADR 0006 - Support a terminal UI as a second local review interface

## Context

Lachesi is currently a Tauri desktop app with a React webview and Rust native
services. The product is also a local-first pull request review workspace, so a
terminal interface can serve users who already live in terminals and want a
fast review surface close to their local repository tools.

The terminal interface must not become a second provider implementation. The
existing decisions keep external-provider HTTP, credential lookup, local
repository operations, and review publication in Rust, with secrets outside the
webview. Those boundaries are still the right ones for a TUI: the TUI should
share the same native services and product semantics instead of duplicating
network clients, storing secrets differently, or publishing comments
immediately.

The implementation should also learn from the local Salieri Tracker reference:
keep terminal rendering and layout testable, keep terminal raw-mode lifecycle
small and robust, and suspend the terminal cleanly when launching external
tools.

## Capability statement

Lachesi will support a terminal UI as a second local review interface in this
repository. The TUI runs as a separate Rust entrypoint, reuses the same native
configuration, credential, provider, local-repository, and review services as
the desktop app, and preserves Lachesi's staged review workflow.

## User stories / scenarios

- As a reviewer, I can browse configured repositories and open pull requests
  from a terminal without launching the desktop webview.
- As a reviewer, I can inspect pull request details, comments, and unified
  diffs using the same provider data and credentials as the desktop app.
- As a reviewer, I can stage review comments locally and explicitly publish
  them in a batch, matching the desktop review model.
- As a reviewer, I can drop into an installed terminal git tool for local repo
  work instead of Lachesi rebuilding a complete git TUI.
- As a maintainer, I can test TUI layout and view state without a real terminal
  session or provider network calls.

## Acceptance criteria

1. The TUI is implemented in this repository as a separate Rust entrypoint or
   workspace crate, not as a separate repository.
2. Provider HTTP, credential lookup, configuration, local repository
   resolution, and review storage are reused from Rust native modules rather
   than reimplemented for the TUI.
3. Tauri command names and mock IPC contracts remain stable unless a command
   contract intentionally changes in the same implementation change.
4. The first TUI release supports configured repositories, open pull request
   listing, selected pull request details, comments, and unified diff viewing.
5. TUI review comments are staged locally first and published only through an
   explicit batch publish action.
6. Terminal rendering and layout have focused tests using a terminal test
   backend or equivalent non-interactive renderer.
7. Launching external git tooling from the TUI suspends and restores terminal
   state cleanly and does not require widening shipped Tauri capabilities.

## Out of scope

- Splitting the TUI into a separate repository before shared Rust boundaries are
  stable.
- Replacing the Tauri desktop app or React webview.
- Rebuilding the full feature set of `lazygit` inside Lachesi.
- Supporting split diff rendering in the first TUI release.
- Adding new provider credentials or token stores for the TUI.

## Open questions

- None.
