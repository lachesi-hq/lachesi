# Restrict localStorage to isolated preference and draft modules

## Context

Lachesi uses browser storage for a small set of user-local concerns while running outside Tauri and inside the webview:

- theme preference in `src/hooks/useTheme.ts`
- per-repo AI review prompt overrides in `src/lib/reviewPrompt.ts`
- staged draft comments in `src/hooks/useDraftComments.ts`
- per-PR review references (Jira/Notion links) in `src/lib/reviewReferencesStorage.ts`
- per-PR viewed-file state in `src/lib/viewedFilesStorage.ts`
- menu-bar pull request notification snapshots in `src/lib/menuBarPrSnapshotStorage.ts`
- collapsed repository state in `src/components/pr-sidebar/PrSidebar.tsx`
- mock IPC review persistence for browser dev/Storybook mode in `src/mock-tauri/mock-handlers.ts`

Those cases are intentionally local, user-scoped, and non-secret. They are also isolated behind small modules with explicit storage keys and graceful failure handling.

The risk is not the existing usage itself; it is the tendency for `localStorage` to spread opportunistically into unrelated UI code for state that should instead live in React state, config, or native storage.

## Decision

Lachesi will restrict direct `localStorage` access to a small, explicit set of modules that own local-only preferences or staged review state.

Today the allowed modules are:

- `src/hooks/useTheme.ts`
- `src/lib/reviewPrompt.ts`
- `src/hooks/useDraftComments.ts`
- `src/lib/reviewReferencesStorage.ts`
- `src/lib/viewedFilesStorage.ts`
- `src/lib/menuBarPrSnapshotStorage.ts`
- `src/components/pr-sidebar/PrSidebar.tsx`
- `src/mock-tauri/mock-handlers.ts`

Any new direct `localStorage` usage outside those modules requires an ADR update or a deliberate exception.

Durable, structured, or application-wide data should not use `localStorage` at all — it belongs in native, Tauri-backed persistence. Readest (the reference app for this work) keeps durable data behind a `FileSystem` abstraction with an atomic-save persistence helper and localStorage only for lightweight, ephemeral UI preferences; Lachesi already follows this shape by keeping saved reviews in `~/.local/share/lachesi/` via Rust (see `CLAUDE.md`).

Components and feature hooks must call these owner modules instead of performing ad hoc inline
storage reads/writes.

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do

- Keep `localStorage` access encapsulated in small owner modules
- Use namespaced keys for stored values
- Handle storage failures defensively
- Prefer native config or Tauri-backed persistence for cross-device, secret, or application-wide configuration

### Don't

- Don't access `localStorage` ad hoc from arbitrary components
- Don't store credentials, tokens, or other secrets in browser storage
- Don't use `localStorage` as a generic substitute for application state management
- Don't introduce new storage keys without a clear owner module

## Consequences

### Positive

- Browser persistence remains easy to reason about
- Secret or app-level state is less likely to leak into web storage
- Governance can catch storage sprawl early with a simple rule

### Negative

- New persistence use cases require explicit design rather than quick inline storage calls
- Some small UX conveniences may feel slower to implement because they need a clear owner

### Risks

- The allowlist must be updated when a genuinely new local-only persistence case is introduced
- Tests that intentionally touch `localStorage` may need to reuse existing storage owners instead of adding bespoke access sites

## Compliance and Enforcement

An automated rule enforces one high-confidence invariant:

- direct `localStorage` access in `src/` is only allowed in the approved owner modules

Code review should still reject broader violations that are not yet machine-checked, such as:

- poorly named storage keys
- long-lived data kept in browser storage when native config would be more appropriate
