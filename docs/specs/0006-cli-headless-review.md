# Spec 0006 - v0.1 CLI and Headless Review Mode

- Status: Draft
- Date: 2026-06-23
- GitHub issue: #30

## Context

Lachesi is currently Tauri-first:

- the executable entrypoint is the desktop app
- Bitbucket access, review execution, review persistence, fix sessions, and
  publication primitives are exposed as Tauri commands
- local repo resolution already exists in Rust
- normalized `ReviewRun`, `Finding`, and `EvidenceArtifact` contracts already
  exist
- repo-owned config, policy sources, and local evidence pipeline specs now
  define shared behavior that should not be desktop-only

CLI mode is therefore not just a thin wrapper around UI commands. v0.1 requires
a reusable review core that both the Tauri adapter and the future CLI adapter can
call.

## Goals

- define the split between reusable review core, Tauri desktop adapter, and CLI
  adapter
- define a first CLI command surface focused on review execution
- reuse normalized review output rather than inventing CLI-only result shapes
- support local interactive and CI usage
- define markdown, JSON, and exit-code behavior
- document authentication and repository assumptions for Bitbucket-linked flows

## Non-goals

- full desktop parity in the first CLI cut
- interactive chat threads
- staging or publishing Bitbucket draft comments from CLI
- fix/commit/push automation from CLI
- hosted orchestration or enterprise reporting

## Architecture

### Reusable Review Core

The review core should be a Rust module or crate with no Tauri dependency.

It owns:

- loading effective config
- resolving local repo context
- collecting Bitbucket PR metadata and diff payloads through provider clients
- collecting Jira/Notion/resource context when configured
- running local evidence analyzers
- building the AI review prompt
- invoking the model provider
- materializing `ReviewRun`, `Finding`, and `EvidenceArtifact`
- persisting review store updates through an injected storage interface

It should expose an API shaped like:

```rust
pub struct ReviewRequest {
    pub workspace: String,
    pub repo: String,
    pub pr_id: u32,
    pub repo_path: Option<PathBuf>,
    pub output_format: ReviewOutputFormat,
    pub profile: Option<String>,
    pub evidence_only: bool,
    pub fail_on_findings: bool,
    pub session_instruction: Option<String>,
}

pub struct ReviewExecutionResult {
    pub run: ReviewRun,
    pub markdown: String,
    pub warnings: Vec<String>,
    pub analyzer_failures: Vec<String>,
}
```

The exact Rust type names can change, but the boundary matters: desktop and CLI
should call the same review orchestration code.

### Tauri Desktop Adapter

The Tauri adapter owns:

- command registration in `src-tauri/src/lib.rs`
- UI-oriented run state and live logs
- cancellation buttons and progress polling
- chat threads and replies
- draft-comment staging and publication
- fix sessions, commit, and push workflows

Desktop can keep richer state than CLI, but review results should still flow
through the shared `ReviewRun` contract.

### CLI Adapter

The CLI adapter owns:

- argument parsing
- terminal output
- process exit codes
- CI-friendly non-interactive behavior
- reading stdin only where explicitly supported

The CLI should not import or initialize a Tauri runtime.

## Command Surface

### `lachesi review`

Primary v0.1 command:

```sh
lachesi review --workspace example-workspace --repo frontend-app --pr 1731
```

Options:

```sh
lachesi review \
  --workspace <workspace> \
  --repo <repo> \
  --pr <id> \
  [--repo-path <path>] \
  [--config <path>] \
  [--local-config <path>] \
  [--format markdown|json|jsonl] \
  [--profile <name>] \
  [--output <path>] \
  [--evidence-only] \
  [--fail-on-findings] \
  [--min-severity info|low|medium|high|critical] \
  [--session-instruction <text>] \
  [--no-jira] \
  [--no-notion]
```

Defaults:

- `--format markdown`
- repo path comes from app config, explicit `--repo-path`, or discovery
- `.lachesi.yaml` is loaded from repo root when present
- `--profile` overrides `review.profile`; if omitted, `review.profile` or a
  `default` profile is used when configured
- local `.lachesi.local.yaml` is loaded when present
- manual publication is not attempted
- findings do not fail the process unless `--fail-on-findings` is set

### `lachesi config validate`

Validates effective config without running review:

```sh
lachesi config validate --repo-path .
```

Exit behavior follows the config exit-code model below.

### `lachesi evidence`

Optional v0.1 command if implemented early:

```sh
lachesi evidence --workspace example-workspace --repo frontend-app --pr 1731 --format json
```

This runs configured analyzers and emits evidence without invoking the model.
Equivalent behavior is also available through `lachesi review --evidence-only`.

## Output Formats

### Markdown

Human-readable output for local terminal usage.

It should include:

- review title and PR identifier
- summary
- findings grouped by severity
- file/line anchors when present
- evidence and analyzer warnings
- selected review profile, when one was used
- footer with run id and schema version

### JSON

Machine-readable output for CI and downstream tools.

The top-level JSON object should be:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": "v0.1",
  "status": "succeeded",
  "exitCode": 1,
  "warnings": [],
  "analyzerFailures": [],
  "reviewRun": {
    "id": "run-1",
    "schemaVersion": "v0.1",
    "provider": "bitbucket",
    "reviewProfile": "agentic-balanced",
    "findings": [],
    "evidence": []
  }
}
```

`reviewRun` must use the same contract documented in the findings spec.

### JSONL

Streaming format for CI logs and long-running reviews.

Example events:

```jsonl
{"type":"started","workspace":"example-workspace","repo":"frontend-app","prId":1731}
{"type":"log","message":"Running analyzer: tsc"}
{"type":"warning","message":"Semgrep skipped: command not found"}
{"type":"result","reviewRun":{...}}
```

JSONL is useful for future integrations but can be deferred if JSON and markdown
ship first.

## Exit Codes

```text
0  review completed and no failing condition was requested
1  review completed, findings at or above threshold exist, and --fail-on-findings was set
2  config validation failed
3  authentication or authorization failed
4  repository or PR could not be resolved
5  analyzer required by config failed, timed out, or could not start
6  model provider failed
7  runtime/internal error
130 cancelled by user
```

Analyzer failures are non-fatal by default. They use exit code `5` only when the
effective config marks the analyzer as required.

Findings use exit code `1` only when `--fail-on-findings` is set. The threshold
is controlled by `--min-severity` or repo config.

## Local Interactive Usage

Local usage optimizes for readable terminal output:

```sh
lachesi review --workspace example-workspace --repo backend-api --pr 1020
```

Expected behavior:

- use app config and keychain credentials when available
- resolve local repo path from explicit flag, settings, or discovery
- load `.lachesi.yaml` and `.lachesi.local.yaml`
- print progress to stderr
- print markdown result to stdout unless `--output` is set
- write structured review state to the same local review store if configured

## CI Usage

CI usage should be deterministic and non-interactive:

```sh
lachesi review \
  --workspace "$BITBUCKET_WORKSPACE" \
  --repo "$BITBUCKET_REPO_SLUG" \
  --pr "$BITBUCKET_PR_ID" \
  --repo-path "$PWD" \
  --format json \
  --fail-on-findings \
  --min-severity high
```

CI assumptions:

- repo path is explicit
- credentials come from environment or an injected credential provider
- no desktop settings dialog exists
- no Tauri runtime exists
- output should be stable enough for artifacts and annotations

CI should not attempt interactive publication in v0.1.

## Auth and Provider Assumptions

Bitbucket-linked review requires:

- workspace
- repo slug
- PR id
- credentials from keychain, environment, or injected CLI credential provider

The core should preserve the existing security boundary:

- secrets are not read from `.lachesi.yaml`
- secrets are not included in JSON output
- webview-only assumptions must not leak into CLI

Jira and Notion enrichment are optional. Missing enrichment credentials should
warn, not fail review, unless future config marks them required.

## Desktop Behaviors Excluded From v0.1 CLI

The first CLI cut intentionally excludes:

- chat replies to an existing review thread
- manual pending-review draft staging
- publishing Bitbucket comments
- AI fix sessions
- commit and push workflow
- conflict resolution workflow
- GUI progress panes and stored UI layout

These can be added later after the shared review core is stable.

## Implementation Plan

1. Extract review orchestration from Tauri command handlers into a core module.
2. Keep Tauri commands as thin adapters that call the core and update UI stores.
3. Define a storage trait for review-store persistence.
4. Define provider traits for Bitbucket, Jira, Notion, and model execution.
5. Add a CLI binary entrypoint that calls the core without Tauri.
6. Implement `lachesi config validate`.
7. Implement `lachesi review --format markdown|json`.
8. Add `--evidence-only` once analyzer execution is available.

The extraction should be incremental. Desktop behavior must keep working while
core logic moves behind adapter boundaries.
