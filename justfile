# Lachesi task runner (Windows).
# macOS/Linux contributors use the parallel `Makefile`; recipe names are kept in
# parity across both files per ADR ARCH-007. Recipes delegate to the canonical
# package.json / cargo / tauri commands so package.json stays authoritative.

# Run recipes through the native Windows PowerShell instead of just's default
# `sh` (which is not present on a standard Windows machine). See ADR ARCH-007.
# -ExecutionPolicy Bypass applies to this spawned process only (no machine-wide
# change) so PowerShell script shims like pnpm.ps1 run under a Restricted policy.
